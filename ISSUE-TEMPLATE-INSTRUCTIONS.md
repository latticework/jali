## General Instructions

### Issue workflow

The Jali repository uses [ZenHub][zen-hub] for project management. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md] for the proper workflow for Jali GitHub issues. If
you are a `non-contributor`, please enter your issue using the
`Question` or `Idea` form. See the [¬ß Template Form Decision Tree](#template-form-decision-tree)
for exact instructions.

### Commit types

An issue can be focused by specifying what kind of commit is envisioned
by a change. If more than one type of commit is associated with the
issue, consider how you can break it up into multiple issues.

> **Important:** See
> [CONTRIBUTING.md ¬ß Commit types][commit-types] for list of commit types
> and their emoji character representations.

## Template Form Decision Tree

Use the following decision tree to choose the appropriate form:

1. Are you a `non-contributor` or a `contributor`? If `non-contributor`,
   go to **(A)**; if `contributor`, go to **(D)**.
1. **(A)** You are a `non-contributor`. Are you suggesting a change to
   current documentation, implementation, or behavior of the Jali
   developer experience or system operation? If yes, go to **(C)**;
   otherwise, go to **(B)**.
1. **(B)** You are a `non-contributor` asking a question. Enter any bug
   reports also as a question. Go to **(J)**.
1. **(C)** You are a `non-contributor` wanting an enhancement. Is the
   change really just a defect from documented functionality? If yes, go
   to **(B)**. Otherwise, are you quite certain the desired change or
   addition does not exist? If yes, go to **(K)**; otherwise, go to **(B)**.
1. **(D)** You are a `contributor`. If you have a question, go to
   **(E)**, if a bug report, go to **(F)**; otherwise, go to **(H)**.
1. **(E)** You are a `contributor` asking a question. Go to **(J)**.
1. **(F)** Do you have enough details to complete the `Bug` form? If
   yes, go to **(G)**; otherwise, go to **(E)**.
1. **(G)** You are a `contributor` entering a bug report. If you are a 
   `core-contributor` go to **(L)**; otherwise, go to **(J)**.
1. **(H)** You are a `contributor` wanting an enhancement. Do you you
   have enough information to fill out the `Enhancement` form? If yes,
   go to **(I)**; otherwise, go to **(K)**.
1. **(I)** Are you a `core-contributor` that needs to create an `Epic`?
   If yes, go to **(N)**; otherwise, if you are a `core-contributor`, go
   to **(M)**. If not, go to **(K)**.
1. **(J)** Check on [StackOverflow][stack-overflow-jali] if the question
   has been asked already. If not, and it meets StackOverflow criteria
   for questions, create a StackOverflow question; otherwise, create a
   [Question](#question-‚ùì-question).
   ‚ùå
1. **(K)** Create an [Idea](#idea-‚ùì-bulb). ‚ùå
1. **(L)** Create a [Bug](#bug-üêû-beetle). ‚ùå
1. **(M)** Create an [Enhancement](#enhancement-‚ñ∂Ô∏èÔ∏è-arrow_forward). ‚ùå
1. **(N)** Create an [Epic](#epic-üé•-movie_camera). ‚ùå


## Template Forms

### Question ‚ùì `:question:`

Usage questions should be asked at [StackOverflow][stack-overflow-jali].
However, not all questions are appropriate for StackOverflow. See
[Welcome to Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tour) for
what kinds of questions are appropriate for StackOverflow. Use the
`jali` tag for questions about Jali. Other questions should be asked in,
this, the `jali` GitHub repo, by creating an issue using the `Question`
form. If you are a non-`core-contributor`, enter a `Bug` using the
`Question` form.  A `core-contributor` may create a `Bug` for you.

#### Question Instructions

- **Title**
  - Use a short interrogative sentence, i.e. a question, that
    should be under 120 characters in length.
  - End with the emoji sequence: `‚ùì` `<`[commit-type-emoji][commit-types]`>` `üéÅ`
- **Commit Type**
  - Use the commit types most closely related to your question.
- **Question Details**
  - Feel free to add formatting and images. For log dumps and other
    large data, attach documents. If you have created a PR or are a
    non-core contributor, keep the **Question** header but include
    the `Bug` form body.

```markdown
# Question: `<commit-type-name>`

## Details


```

### Idea üí° `:bulb:`

An `Idea` is a suggested change to the system. If you not a
`core-contributor` and intend to submit a GitHub PR, you should submit
an `Idea` issue first, then reference the Idea from the PR. A

    characters in length.

```markdown
# Idea: `<commit-type-name>`

The `Bug` form should only be used by `core-contributors`; others should
use the `Idea` form. A `Bug` is a defect of the intended function of the product.

use the `Enhancement` form; otherwise, use the `Idea` form. Bugs are
formal issues. Please fill the form out completely.

    behavior. It should be under 120 characters in length.

    - `5 Documentation Error`
    - `6 Cosmetic Defect`
- **Bug Description**

    or logs, add attachments in the **Defective Behavior** section,
    instead.
- **Steps to Reproduce**
  - Provide a repeatable sequence of steps that reproduce the defect. At
    the end, describe how the tester can verify that the bug has been
    reproduced. If you can't reproduce the bug reliably, submit an `Idea`
    instead, using the `Bug` form template.
- **Defective Behavior**
  - Explain erroneous outcome. Include images and attachments, such as
    logs, if possible.
- **Desired Behavior**
  - Explain how you think the product ought to operate. Include images,
    if possible.
